    "description": "The discipline of chemical engineering is concerned with the design, construction and operation of all the processes involved in these industries. Serious considerations are given in all of these industries to safety and environmental protection. The course of study requires basic knowledge of Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics at Advanced Level (A’ Level) status, and comprises a balanced curriculum of basic chemical engineering analysis, but with a significant component of practical and project work in engineering applications, computer studies and industrial plant projects. In the final year programme, students are required to carry out the design of a plant-this being the culmination of the programme of studies. The programme is ideal as a background for postgraduate studies in many areas, including petroleum engineering. ",

The Major in Film Production is offered by the Faculty of Humanities and Education as an interdisciplinary programme designed to teach potential filmmakers the technical skills of production at the very highest level, and to ensure that these filmmakers understand the theoretical and aesthetic principles of film. The programme is designed to ensure that this balance between theory and practice is maintained. The programme is also designed to teach high-level analytical and critical skills, so that future filmmakers may assess their own work and the work of other filmmakers. The Major in Film Studies is designed to teach students to evaluate, critique and analyse film products and to understand how film images work. It ensures that future critics and aestheticians of film will also be grounded in the basic technical skills of filmmaking.",
