The programme is designed to ensure that this balance between theory and practice is maintained. The programme is also designed to teach high-level analytical and critical skills, so that future filmmakers may assess their own work and the work of other filmmakers. The Major in Film Studies is designed to teach students to evaluate, critique and analyse film products and to understand how film images work.
